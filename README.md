# graphics-breakdown
This is a barebones graphics engine designed to understand abstraction and have a decent idea of how a graphics program runs.

If you wish to compile this code there isnt a texture committed into the code for the program to work, so you must either:
+ go back a few commits or,
+ find out the filename of the missing texture and add the path to the build directory after compiling

in order to compile you need to pull all the submodules first before calling 
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
